1. Dependencies
===============

Server:
* Node.js
* Socket.io

Client:
* HTML5 canvas compatible browser (Most modern are)

2. Usage
========

Download the code to a folder. Go to the folder with
your favorite terminal. Start the server with node.js
in a terminal:

 > node server.js

NOTE: Socket.io uses ports in the range below 1000 and
might need root-acess in order use them. If an error
is presented just start it with root acess.

In Ubuntu:

 > sudo node server.js

Now use your browser to surf in to the server on port
8080. The adress should be:

 http://localhost:8080/

Thats it!

If something is not working check the terminal for
debugging messages or clues.
